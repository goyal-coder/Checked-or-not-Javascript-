Checkbox Checker 🎯
A simple and interactive web application to demonstrate the use of radio buttons and JavaScript to handle user input. The user selects either "Yes" or "No" and gets a response based on their choice.

Features ✨
Radio Buttons: Users can select either "Yes" or "No".

Submit Button: Triggers the response based on the selected option.

Dynamic Response: Displays a message depending on the user's choice.

Clean UI: Simple and user-friendly design.

How It Works 🛠️
The user selects either "Yes" or "No" using the radio buttons.

When the Submit button is clicked:

If "Yes" is selected, the message "Checked the checkbox" is displayed.

If "No" is selected, the message "BRUHHHHHHHHHH" is displayed.

The result is shown below the button.

Code Structure 🧑‍💻
HTML
Container: A centered container holds the radio buttons, submit button, and result message.

Radio Buttons: Two radio buttons with labels for "Yes" and "No".
